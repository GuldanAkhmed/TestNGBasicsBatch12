TestNG:
is a testing tool that helps us to structure our test cases using different annotations

Benefits of testNG:
1.Reports
2.Annotations  e.g @Test, @before ,@beforeclass
3.parallel testing
4.batch execution
5.Assertions--> Hard Assertions , SoftAssertions
6.Data Parameterization

it can be integrated with cucumber , maven and selenium.



1.Annotations:
we donot need any main method

annotation is a tag that provides additional inforamtion about class, interface or method in testNG
anotation are used to keep the strucutre of test cases

@Test
@BeforeMethod
@AfterMethod
@BeforeClass
@AfterClass


1.@Test
You should write your test cases under this annotation.
This is the main annotation in testNG
By default testNG excutes the methods in alphabetical order.


2.@BeforeMethod:
runs every time before the @test is executed
also called precondition

3.@AfterMethod:
runs after each @test Method
also called post condition


before method is preconditon that must run before every test case and the post conditon will run after
the test case has ended

priority:
by deafault the priority is zero of all the test case
in order to give them a priority order
use @Test(priority =1)


Enabled:
@Test(enabled=false)--> will not run the test cases that are set false
by deafult all test cases are set to enabled=true

DependsOn:

@Test(dependsOnMethods = "methodName")
will only run if the depndent method has passed successfully else it will be skipped
