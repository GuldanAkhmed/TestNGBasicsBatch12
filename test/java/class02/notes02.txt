What Is TestNG.Xml?
TestNG.xml file is a configuration file that helps in organizing our tests.
It allows testers to create and handle multiple test classes, define test suites and tests.

It makes a tester’s job easier by controlling the execution of
 tests by putting all the test cases together and run it under one XML file.
  This is a beautiful concept, without which, it is difficult to work in TestNG.

Advantages Of TestNG.xml
Major advantages of TestNG.xml file are:

It provides parallel execution of test methods.
It allows the dependency of one test method on another test method.
It helps in prioritizing our test methods.
It allows grouping of test methods into test groups.
It supports the parameterization of test cases using @Parameters annotation.
It helps in Data-driven testing using @DataProvider annotation.
It has different types of assertions that help in validating the expected results with the actual results.
It has different types of HTML reports, Extent reports, etc. for a better and clear understanding of our test summary.
It has listeners who help in creating logs.
